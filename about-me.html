                Therapy should be available to everyone, and I aim to meet each of my clients' unique needs.
                I work in a wide range of creative ways, as well as 'traditional' talking therapy.
                <br /><br />
                I have supported people who thought that they would never find a therapist to help
                them for all sorts of reasons including their sexuality or their disability -
                even not being able to talk was not a barrier...
                <br /><br />
                I can help you if you are feeling anxious, sad or depressed.
                These are often feelings that have their roots in identity or relationship problems,
                feelings of low self-worth or self-disgust and shame.
                I can hold what feels like really difficult stuff in a warm, helpful, confidential way -
                and I doubt you could truly shock me.
                <br /><br />
                Whether you are seeking solace or have run out of places to hide,
                together we can create a space where you find what you need so that you can be the best version of a whole you.
                <hr />
                I have specialist areas in supporting people with learning disabilities, autistic spectrum disorders or both,
                their families and other members of their support network and professionals.
                <br /><br />
                I am also very experienced in working with the vast array of issues within the LGBTQ+ community.
                I have a particular interest where sexuality and genders issues intersect with disability
                <br /><br />
                I also welcome BSL users.
                <hr />
                I am a certified psychotherapist and a registered member of the <abbr title="United Kingdom Council for Psychotherapy">UKCP</abbr>

                            UK Council for Psychotherapy
                            The UK Council for Psychotherapy (UKCP) is a leading professional body for the education, 
                            training and regulation of psychotherapists and psychotherapeutic counsellors. 
                            Its register is accredited by the government's Professional Standards Authority.

                            As part of its commitment to protect the public, it works to improve access to psychotherapy, 
                            to support and disseminate research, to improve standards and to respond effectively 
                            to complaints against its members.

                            UKCP standards cover the range of different psychotherapies. 
                            Registration is obtained by training or accrediting with one of 
                            its member organisations, or by holding a European Certificate in Psychotherapy. 
                            Accredited by the Professional Standards Authority.
